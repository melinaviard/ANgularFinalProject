# ProjetFinal
This is the final project for our JAVA formation.
Our theme is the transport. So we decide to do a web application for car's renting. Our idea is to facilitate the use of the application for both the customer and the employees. 
In a sprint of one and a half week, we manage to do all the backend, we run units test for two controllers (Client and Vehicule), one DAO (Reservation) and we work in TDD for the Service (Client).
