# ProjetFinal
This is the final project for our JAVA formation.
Our theme is the transport. So we decide to do a web application for car's renting. Our idea is to facilitate the use of the application for both the customer and the employees. 
In a sprint of one and a half week, we manage to do all the backend, we run units test for two controllers (Client and Vehicule), one DAO (Reservation) and we work in TDD for the Service (Client).


##Getting Started

These instructions ill get you a copy of the project up and running on your local mahcine so u can use it. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The first page has the path : "accueil". A void path goes equally to the Accueil. 
## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
